# Cloud Visibility

## Public, Private and Hybrid Clouds

### Public Cloud

Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone that would like to purchase it  
Cloud resources (servers, storage) are owned and operated by a third party and delivered over the internet

* A great example of this would be Google Drive where you can create and share files but do not handle the storage. This follows our SaaS model

### Private Cloud

Private consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from a business or organization  
This is managed by the organization it belongs to or by a third party provider used only for this organization

### Hybrid Cloud

Combines these two by allowing data and applications to be shared between them
